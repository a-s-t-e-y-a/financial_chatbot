Spend securely


Credit card is enabled with a chip and PIN facility, offering unrivalled protection
Chip is capable of storing and transacting data in an encrypted format and is encrypted with
                            a PIN that is only known to the cardholder


                        How to use a CHIP and PIN card:
                        Just like a magnetic stripe card, the CHIP and PIN enabled credit card too can be used at the
                        merchant’s payment terminals directly. Instead of swiping the card, merchants need to ‘Dip’ your
                        card into a CHIP reader slot.
                        Paying through CHIP and PIN enabled Credit Card is a 3-step process:
                    

Dip/Swipe your card
